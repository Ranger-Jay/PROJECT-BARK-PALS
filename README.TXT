IN ORDER FOR THE GOOGLE OAUTH2 TO WORK, YOU NEED TO ADD THE SERVER URL THE GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE'S ===> OAuth 2.0 Client IDs =====> Authorized JavaScript origins AND Authorized redirect URIs.

IF YOU'RE RUNNING THIS OFF OF GITPOD, IT WILL BASICLY JUST BE THE LIVE SERVER'S URL.

BE SURE TO RESET IN THE BACK END TERMINAL ====>   $ pipenv run start.

ALSO RESTART IN THE FRONT END TERMINAL ====>  $ npm run start.

--------------

NOTE THAT UNDER A DEDICATED SERVER, THIS WON'T BE AN ISSUE SINCE THE URL WILL ALREADY BE SET ON OAUTH2'S CREDIENTIAL LIST.  YOU JUST HAVE TO RE-DO IT, EACH TIME THE GITPOD LIVE SERVER CHANGES.

THANKS AND ENJOY.  REMEMBER TO GIVE CREDIT, WHERE CREDIT IS DOE.  THANKS, -JAY :)
